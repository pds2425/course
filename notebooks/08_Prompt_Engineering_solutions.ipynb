    "Although large language models excel in zero-shot scenarios, their performance declines on more complex tasks under this setting. To address this, few-shot prompting is employed, leveraging in-context learning. This approach involves including __demonstrations within the prompt__ to guide the model towards improved responses. These examples act as a framework, shaping how the model processes and responds to subsequent inputs. Research by [Touvron et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971.pdf) indicates that few-shot capabilities emerged as models reached a certain scale, as earlier discussed by [Kaplan et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361). To illustrate few-shot prompting, consider an example from [Brown et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165), where the goal is to use a novel word correctly within a sentence."

When providing examples to a language model for a task, it's important that the examples __resemble the actual task__ in both the types of __inputs__ and the possible __outputs__ (label space).

In simple words, you trick the model to return a response that it should not provide. Prompt Injection is one of the topic in Prompt Hacking that aims to exploit vulnerabilities of LLMs by manipulating their inputs or prompts.
